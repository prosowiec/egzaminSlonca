Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Correct Answer,Explanation
"Regarding the pharmacological interactions of Acetylsalicylic Acid (AAS), what is the specific consequence of concurrent administration with Methotrexate?",Decreased absorption of Methotrexate,Increased risk of thrombosis due to platelet aggregation,Increased toxicity of Methotrexate,Decreased hypoglycemic effect,Neutralization of the anti-inflammatory action,Option C,"AAS + Methotrexate -> increased toxicity of Methotrexate"
"Which constellation of symptoms is explicitly described as a potential result of fast Intravenous (IV) use of Metamizole?",Severe bronchoconstriction and anaphylactic shock,Facial flushing heat palpitations hypotension and nausea,Acute hepatic necrosis and jaundice,Reye's syndrome with acute encephalopathy,Gastrointestinal bleeding and duodenal ulcers,Option B,"Fast IV use can produce: facial flushing, heat, palpitations, hypotension and nausea."
"In the context of corticosteroid receptor affinity, which statement accurately characterizes Type II receptors?",They have affinity for both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids,They are exclusively located in the renal cortex,They have mineralocorticoid affinity exclusively,They have glucocorticoid affinity exclusively,They are responsible for the homeostasis of Na+ and K+,Option D,"Type II receptors, glucocorticoid affinity exclusively."
"What is the primary mechanism of action (MOA) of Clonidine that leads to its antihypertensive effect?",Direct blockade of alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle,Blockade of beta-1 receptors in the heart,Alpha-2 feedback inhibition of Norepinephrine (NA) release,Inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase increasing ACh,Direct activation of muscarinic M2 receptors,Option C,"Alpha 2 feedback - inhibition of NA release"
"Regarding the Adverse Reactions of Salicylates, which condition is a prohibited use of AAS in children due to the risk of acute encephalopathy?",Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,Reye's disease,Cushing's Syndrome,Addisonian Crisis,Myasthenia Gravis,Option B,"Reye's disease (acute encephalopathy), prohibited use of AAS in children."
"Which drug is an irreversible inhibitor of Acetylcholinesterase used as an insecticide, and what is its classification?",Atropine (Natural alkaloid),Parathion (Organophosphate inhibitor),Pilocarpine (Direct agonist),Tubocurarine (Nondepolarizing drug),Neostigmine (Quaternary carbamate),Option B,"Organophosphate inhibitors (Parathion; Malathion...), pro-drugs... Reduce acetylcholine degradation (Inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase)"
"What is the specific clinical indication for the use of Atropine in a pre-anesthetic setting?",To induce skeletal muscle relaxation for intubation,To prevent or recover from reflex syncope stimulating HR and reduce gland secretion,To treat malignant hyperthermia,To induce miosis and reduce intraocular pressure,To block neuromuscular transmission at the motor endplate,Option B,"Pre-anesthesic: prevent or recover from reflex syncope stimulating HR and reduce gland secretion (Atropine injected)"
"Which specific risk is associated with Selective COX-2 inhibition compared to non-selective NSAIDs?",High risk of serious cardiovascular accidents,Increased risk of gastrointestinal mucosal damage,Risk of bronchospastic triad,Increased bleeding time due to irreversible platelet inhibition,High risk of agranulocytosis,Option A,"Selective COX-2 inhibition is related to a high risk of serious cardiovascular accidents."
"Identify the correct localization and function of the M2 muscarinic receptor according to the general pharmacology tables.",Exocrine glands (Stimulates secretion),CNS (Cognitive function),Heart-vagus nerve (Inhibits heart),Smooth muscle (Contraction),Sympathetic ganglia (Transmission),Option C,"$M_{2}$ (Heart-vagus nerve)"
"When Acetylsalicylic Acid (AAS) is combined with oral antidiabetics, what interaction occurs?",Decreased absorption of the antidiabetic,Increased hypoglycemic effect,Increased hyperglycemic effect,Inhibition of AAS metabolism,Precipitation of acute renal failure,Option B,"AAS + Oral antidiabetics -> increased hypoglycemic effect"
